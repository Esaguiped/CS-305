# CS-305

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
- Artemis Financial was my client and they wanted me to have secure communications and refactor code that complies with software security testing protocols.

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
- I was able to spot it easily. It's important to code securely so hackers will have less of a chance disrupting the system. Software security plays a crucial role to a company's overall wellbeing.

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challe-nging or helpful?
- It wasn't that difficult for me but there were times where I found it to be challenging. Certificate generation was one I had a tough time with but after going through the course material again, I was able to get past that problem.

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
- Having too much security is never a bad thing so increasing the layers of security was a must. I would try to find the weakest spots in order to find the vulnerabilities.

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- I made sure the program ran smoothly. This ensures I developed proper code in helping me find those vulnerabilities.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
-Resources I used were online sources such as YouTube. There were actually a lot of helpful videos there so I learned a lot.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
- I would want them to see my ability to develop code and determine where the vulnerabilities are. With this skill, I feel confident that they'll see that I'm able to increase security.
